# Terraform Tutorial

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.

This repo contains a simple terraform configuration file that is used to create an ec2 instance in AWS.
